Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from BC, making it over years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum pas2ssage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections and of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 153
